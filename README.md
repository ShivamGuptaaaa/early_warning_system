🎓 Early Warning System for Identifying At-Risk Students Using Predictive Analytics
📌 Overview
This project is designed to help educators and administrators identify at-risk students early on by leveraging predictive analytics. By analyzing student data, such as attendance records, grades, behavioral incidents, and socioeconomic factors, the system generates timely alerts, enabling proactive interventions to improve student outcomes.

🛠️ Key Features
Data Integration and Cleaning: Combine and preprocess multiple data sources, ensuring consistency and quality.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features like attendance rate, grade trends, and behavioral patterns to enhance model accuracy.
Predictive Modeling: Train and deploy multiple machine learning models to predict students at risk of academic failure, absenteeism, or behavioral issues.
Risk-Based Alerts: Automatically generate alerts for at-risk students, including detailed insights and suggested interventions.
Notification System: Send alerts to educators via email or a dedicated dashboard, ensuring timely and actionable notifications.
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA revealed key insights into student performance and behavior:

Total Score Comparison (2021 vs. 2023): Identifies trends in academic performance over time.
Average Total Score by Risk Category: Highlights performance variation among different risk levels.
Impact of Behavioral Risk on Average Scores: Analyzes how behavioral issues correlate with academic performance.
Risk Category Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of students across risk categories.
Grades Impact on Total Average Score: Examines how grades affect overall performance.
Pairplot for Risk Factors: Provides a multi-dimensional view of how various risk factors interact.
📈 Machine Learning Models
Three machine learning models were developed and fine-tuned for optimal performance:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Machine
The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🚨 Alert and Notification System
The system generates alerts for students flagged as "at-risk" by the model. Alerts include key details such as:

Attendance Rate
Average Grades
Behavioral Risk Levels
Suggested Interventions
Educators receive these alerts via email notifications, allowing them to take timely and informed actions.
